## CrearIA
<str>CrearIA: teaching art to machines </str>  is a cultural project by Daniil Valyano and Mariia Chizhikova, two researchers in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Jaén. Their project was selected to be part of the Generación UJA program, which showcases the artistic and cultural talent of the students of the University. 

Instead of using AI techniques to mimic the style of the famous artists, they used AI techniques that mimic the human creative process of making a piece of art. The model they used was trained on a corpus of over 7000 images that are free of copyright and that Daniil Valyano collected from an open source called WikiArt.

The exhibition was held at the Zabaleta Exhibition Hall of the Las Lagunillas Campus. The project showcased the fascinating intersection of art and technology, bridging the gap between the traditionally separated realms of creativity and science. The works on display were not mere objects, but rather intricate processes of gathering, transmitting, analyzing, producing and refining knowledge. CrearIA also invited the attendants to reflect on the artistic potential of AI and the human creativity that defines our species.
